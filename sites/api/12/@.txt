API Overview
The Envato Downloader API is a simple tool that lets users get files from Envato just by providing a link. When a user sends a link to the API, it will give back two things: 01. The File to Download: This is the main file that the link points to. 02. The License: This is a document that shows the legal rights to use the file. With this API, users don't need to worry about extra steps. They just send a link, and they get everything they need to use the file properly.
