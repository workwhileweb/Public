API Overview
searX is an opensource internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from more than 70 search services. Users are neither tracked nor profiled. searX can fetch search results from about 82 different engines. This includes major search engines and site-specific searches like Bing, Google, Reddit, Wikipedia, Yahoo, and Yandex.
Search API
GET /search
Parameters
q (required): The search query. This string is passed to external search services. Thus, SearXNG supports the syntax of each search service. For example, site:github.com SearXNG is a valid query for Google. However, if the query above is passed to any search engine which does not filter its results based on this syntax, you might not get the results you wanted.
See more at Search syntax.
